						<h3>The Islamic State</h3>
						<p>
							The Islamic State is a Sunni, extremist, jihadist rebel group based in Iraq and Syria. Founded in 1999, they have recently risen to infamy through their brutal viral videos and their alarming expansion throughout the Middle East.
						</p>
						<p>
							The group have proclaimed themselves a caliphate and their official goal is to "rescind the the Sykes-Picot Agreement through the conquest of the Levant the strict enforcement of Sharia law". Although they have officially cut all relations with al-Qaeda, they have recently merged with the al-Nusra terrorist group.
						</p>
						<p>
							In response to their invasion of Iraq, the United States and a global coalition of allies have led a series of airstrikes against the terrorist group. However, despite their constant bombardment, they have acquired a quasi-empire the size of Great Britain. They also claim that to have acquired Uranium-238, and now threatened to create Dirty Bombs and , potentially, WMDs. Now many fear that ISIL's unprecedented strength may force the US and NATO into another full scale conflict in the Middle East.

						<h3>Medical Marijuana</h3>
						<p>
							In 1972, the US Congress placed marijuana in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act because they considered it to have "no accepted medical use." Since then, 23 of 50 US states and DC have legalized the medical use of marijuana.
						</p>
						<p>
							Proponents of medical marijuana argue that it can be a safe and effective treatment for the symptoms of cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, pain, glaucoma, epilepsy, and other conditions. They cite dozens of peer-reviewed studies, prominent medical organizations, major government reports, and the use of marijuana as medicine throughout world history.
						</p>
						<p>
							Opponents of medical marijuana argue that it is too dangerous to use, lacks FDA-approval, and that various legal drugs make marijuana use unnecessary. They say marijuana is addictive, leads to harder drug use, interferes with fertility, impairs driving ability, and injures the lungs, immune system, and brain. They say that medical marijuana is a front for drug legalization and recreational use.

						<h3>Abortion</h3>
						<p>
							The debate over whether or not abortion should be a legal option continues to divide Americans long after the US Supreme Courtâ€™s 7-2 decision on Roe v. Wade declared the procedure a "fundamental right" on Jan. 22, 1973.
						</p>
						<p>
							Proponents, identifying themselves as pro-choice, contend that choosing abortion is a woman's right that should not be limited by governmental or religious authority, and which outweighs any right claimed for an embryo or fetus. They say that pregnant women will resort to unsafe illegal abortions if there is no legal option.
						</p>
						<p>
							Opponents, identifying themselves as pro-life, contend that personhood begins at conception, and therefore abortion is the immoral killing of an innocent human being. They say abortion inflicts suffering on the unborn child, and that it is unfair to allow abortion when couples who cannot biologically conceive are waiting to adopt.
